# push_swap - @42Born2Code

## What's the goal of push_swap?

The objective of push_swap is to efficiently sort data using two stacks with the fewest possible operations.

## Why would you do this?

To learn how to choose and implement different sorting algorithms for a given constrain.

### What did i learn from it?

- Understanding and applying Big O notation.
- Choose and implement sorting algorithms so they work with a given problem.
- Improve the implementation more and more to get better results.
- Additionally, I developed a graphical tool called push_swap_clicker, enabling experimentation with various approaches without the need for coding. Check it out here: [Push_swap_clicker](https://github.com/stevebalk/push-swap-clicker)


# Different sorting algorithms like: 
- Quicksort (utilized)
- Insertion sort (utilized)
- Bubble sort
- Radix sort
- Merge sort
